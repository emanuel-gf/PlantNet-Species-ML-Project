    "# GeoPlant Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPlant is a large-scale, multimodal dataset for spatial plant species prediction across Europe, combining expert-verified species observations with rich environmental context\n",
    "\n",
    "The application domain for the dataset is mostly related with Ecological researchers, Biologists, Botanicts and also Machine Learning/ Remote Sensing Researcher. Due the broad scope of Environmental variables, it can be use for a range of professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a target variable, the GeoPlant contains either Presence-Absence (PA) or Presence-Only (PO) survey polygons. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Presence-Absence (PA)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Survey inventory of all plants species in a given plot (10-400 m² ).\n",
    "\n",
    " - Source: 29 datasets hosted in the European Vegetation Archive (EVA)\n",
    "\n",
    " - 93,703 surveys across Europe with 5,016 plant species.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environmental Variables | Features \n",
    "\n",
    "For each surveyId, a set of environmental variables is associated with it. The environmental variables are composed by 5 major datasets, they are:\n",
    "- Climatic Variables\n",
    "- Soil variables\n",
    "- Human Footprint\n",
    "- Elevation\n",
    "- Land Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "The GeoPlant dataset allow retrieving the environmental variables as a tabular data where the features are already extracted for each surveyId, which means that instead of dealing with huge raster datasets, the GeoPlant provides a tabular light-weighted version for end-users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Climatic Variables:\n",
    " 19 climatic variables averaged over 1981-2010. \n",

So, all altitude above will be replaced with the standard altitude of 1500m. \n",
